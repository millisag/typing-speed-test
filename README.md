# typing-speed-test
Simple typing test that displays a random quote from an api and measures the user's speed and time taken to complete the test. The test also includes a counter that displays how many typing challenges the user has completed. A test is only counted as complete if there are no errors in the user input. 

Features to add/alter: 
1. text should show up as red or green while the user is typing based on whether it matches the quote exactly
2. the user should begin the test by typing in the input box, not clicking a button
